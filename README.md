# nodejs-Rest-Api

Vanilla NodeJS

Testing my nodeJS skills by building a vanilla nodejs Api and Tested it using POSTMAN.

It allows one to create, read, update and delete products. Used various nodeJs modules such as;
 - Http module
 - File system module
 - Events 

Implemented using the Model-view-Controller architectural patterns with Models handling the data and controllers handling the routes.
